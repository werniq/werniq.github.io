            <h3>My passions</h3>
            <p class="bigger-text">
                In context of programming, I have two passions: Golang and Blockchain. With help of Go you can write websites, bots, 
                create your own console applications, microservices, use it to interact with Blockchain, and even write your own Blockchain, using Hyperledger Fabric!
                
                In terms of Blockchain, I am much interested in Ethereum and Hyperledger ones. I have experience in writing smart contracts,
                deploying them on testnets, and interacting with them using Go. I also have experience in writing Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes,
                deploying them on testnets, as well, interacting with them using Go.
            </p>
            <p class="">
                My journey as a developer began four years ago when I delved into Python and quickly grasped the backend concepts. Utilizing the Django framework, I successfully developed several full-stack applications, including e-commerce and news websites. As my passion for technology grew, I ventured into the exciting realms of crypto and blockchain, immersing myself in Solidity and the Ethereum ecosystem. Concurrently, I expanded my knowledge of JavaScript and React, recognizing their compatibility with my interests. 
            </p>

            <p>Seeking professional experience, I embarked on freelance projects and dedicated two years to learning Golang. During this period, I engaged in numerous enterprise-level website development projects and created a variety of bots for platforms such as WhatsApp, Slack, and Discord. Working with diverse APIs like ChatGPT, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Slack, I honed my integration skills. Moreover, I successfully integrated Stripe payments, as well as smart contracts and third-party APIs, into my websites. </p>
            
            
            <p>My proficiency extends beyond Golang, Node.js, TypeScript encompassing React, JavaScript, Docker, AWS services, gRPC with Protocol Buffers, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I possess a comprehensive understanding of blockchain fundamentals, including Go-Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Hardhat, and Truffle frameworks. Additionally, I have experience with such list of technologies: Python, C++, PHP, Unity (C#). </p>
