            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h3>My passions</h3>
            <p>My name is Oleksandr Matviienko, and I am currently looking for Full-Time Golang Developer opportunity. 
                I would like to introduce a bit myself, and my projects.
                <br><br>
                My journey as a developer began few years ago. Being jealous to my classmate, (which was already moving in programming with giant steps)
                I have created a game, which had a logic of simple attraction, somewhere in the spaces of the amusement park. After that, I have been focusing on web development,
                mainly, in Python. I have created News Website, tried to build crypto trading bot, and created a tic tac toe game. 
                <br><br>
                One time, when I was driving in my fathers car, he tried to explain me such complex technology as blockchain in simple terms. When we arrived home, I become curious about it.
                Decentralized, immutable, secure, trustable and transparent database? "Why don't we use it everywhere?",  I thought. I started learning Solidity programming language, and 
                slowly became familiar with Ethereum ecosystem concepts.  
                Time passed, and I began looking for work. Being Solidity developer seemed too monotonously for me. I already knew Python but it also seemed something not like that.. 
                <br><br>
                So, I decided to learn Golang. Go has pleasing to the eye syntax, concurrency interested my from the most beginning. Huge community support means that you won't stuck with
                your problem for a long time. As well as enormous standard library, which is enough to build anything. 
                My developer journey (for this moment) lasts for nearly 3 years, from which 1.5 i have been learning Golang. 
            </p>
