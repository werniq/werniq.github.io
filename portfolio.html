                <b> I took care of the database-related things, while also working closely with the Front-End team to make sure our performance was top-notch. </b><br>
                I was in charge of the server side, <b>making our assistants opearete with services like Google Calendar and Google Sheets. </b> <br>

                <b> We made our app handle over 5,000 users without breaking a sweat through smart optimizations. </b><br>
                We made the app super <b> user-friendly by listening </b>  to what users wanted and doing some research. <br>
                I made sure our service was always up and running by <b> adding backup plans </b> in case things went wrong. <br>
                We finished the project on time thanks to my <b> careful planning and management. </b> <br>
                We got all the security stuff in order by checking things thoroughly and using the best security practices. <br>

		<h2> - AuthDigitBot: </h2> <br>
                            Assistant is used for my custom authentication system in Minecraft server. Initially starting with the network library, the MC TCP-based  <br>
                            network communication protocol was implemented with pure Go. A package is provided to facilitate the writing of command-line MC robot programs. <br>
                            <br>
            
                            Instead of relying on traditional password-based login methods, the bot generates unique codes consisting of digits only.  <br>
                            Users can obtain these codes through the Discord platform, where they are securely generated and distributed. To authenticate on the  <br>
                            Minecraft server, users simply need to enter the code instead of typing their password. This approach enhances security by eliminating  <br>
                            the need to remember or share passwords. <br>
                            <br>
            
                            This bot it best choice for Minecraft server, because it creates a connection with AuthMe plugin database, and sends a message to the user, whenever any other IP address <br>
                            is logged into this account. As well as notifying about attempts to change the password and gaining experience and server currency using a custom quiz system. <br>

                    GymGo is a website, for generating workouts for you.	<br>
                        I was on my way to Gym, and cannot remember some exercises for legs(one reason is because I do them rarely). <br>
                        When I came home, I started building a website, that can generate a whole workout for you, with provided technique, and even a link for proper<br>
                        explanation of the technique on YouTube. You can all exercises for a particular muscle group (back, chest, biceps, etc..), as well as choose<br>
                        muscle groups you want to target, enter a count of exercises for each, and generate a workout. After that, I never skipped leg day :D<br>

                <h2> - S3 Compatible HTTP Service: </h2> <br>
                    An S3-compatible HTTP service refers to a service that implements an API that is compatible with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).  <br>
                    Amazon S3 is a popular cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data. <br>
                    I decided to create my own one, and really enjoyed in the process! I have implemented functionality to interact with that API using the front-end side, and it works fine. <br>
                    <br>
                        It provides functionality such as:<br>
                    
                    <div class="indented-text">
                        1. Create a bucket<br>
                        2. Upload files to a bucket<br>
                        3. Get files from a bucket<br>
                        4. Get a file from a bucket (using some key)<br>
                        5. Check the bucket name for proper verification of creating a bucket<br>
                    </div>
                        You can upload files from the front-end as well.

                <h2> - EmpowerMentor: </h2> <br>
                        This is my current project. I am working on a bot, which will focus on self-improvement.   <br>
                        It notifies you about drinking water, exercising, meditating, and reading once a day (Drink water a few times), and sends motivational quotes once a day (with the ability to create your own)  <br>
                        It may be used to create personal workouts, supplement intake plan, generating meal prepare plan for the day (or the whole week), based on the maximum calories count,  <br>
                        excluding products, which you have an allergy to. It sends you recommendations for your mental health, for better sleeping, and physical health. As well, throughout the  <br>
                        day, it sends you challenges. For example: run 110% of your normal distance, take an ice bath, or cold shower. It has two types of users: ordinary users and admin.  <br>
                        AdminsId are stored in the database, and admins may view issues related to bot functionality. Admins may upload new challenges, new motivational quotes, manage users,  <br>
                        subscriptions. On the user's configuration of the bot, it requires you to provide wake-up and bedtime. At that time, it will send you an appropriate message. You can change it,  <br>
                        in addition to a preferable time for meditation, reading, and exercise (which you input in setting up the bot). Hope, it will help someone to become more disciplined and more stoic :D  <br>
