            <h1>My skill set</h1>
            <h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>As I said in the "About" section, I am passionate about Golang and blockchain. So I have been
                learning tools and technologies that might be useful in connection with Golang and blockchain. Firstly,
                A good fit for Solidity would be React.js and JavaScript for interacting with smart contracts. For, actual,
                interacting, I was using Ethers.js and Web3.js while working with Hardhat and Truffle. When I started learning Golang, I was focusing
                Chi router first, then Gin router. I was using PostgreSQL for databases. When I started
                Focusing on blockchain, I have learned Go-Ethereum and slowly started learning Hyperledger Fabric.
                When it came time to deploy my projects, I was using Docker and Docker-Compose. I was using Nginx for
                reverse proxy, and Certbot for SSL certificates. I was using AWS EC2 for hosting my projects.
                In the background, I was working freelance and becoming familiar with such technologies as
                Docker, AWS, Nginx, Certbot, and many more. I was using Git for version control and GitHub for
                hosting my projects. Docker and AWS are my favorite tools, and I use them on a daily basis.
                really enjoy working with them. I am also highly skilled in TypeScript and Node.js.
